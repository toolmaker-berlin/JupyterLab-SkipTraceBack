# JupyterLab-SkipTraceBack

'Proof of concept' for an extension like "skip traceback" known from Jupyter Notebook (NBExtensions)

I've recently changed from Jupyter Notebook to JupyterLAB 2.11 because it's more comfortable.   
But what I really missed was the "skip traceback"-option from the classic notebook. As I didn't find any solution on the web, I tried to write my own one.  

This is my first programme since I started learning python. My actual profession is programming in Assembler/C (x86, 68k, Z80, 6502, PIC etc.). Besides I'm a "toolmaker" writing assembler, disassembler, helper functions, tools etc.

I was inspired by the following sites:

Thanks a lot!
