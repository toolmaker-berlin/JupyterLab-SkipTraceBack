# JupyterLab-SkipTraceBack

'Proof of concept' for an extension like "skip traceback" known from Jupyter Notebook (NBExtensions) 
<br>

I switch from Jupyter Notebook to JupyterLAB 2.11. Everthing looks nice.  
But I really miss the "skip traceback"-Option from the classic notebook system. I dosn't find any solution, so I try to write one.  

This is my first program since I switched to (learning) python. My profession is programming in Assembler/C (x86, 68k, Z80, 6502, PIC etc.) and for my interest only, I am a "toolmaker", writing assembler, disassembler, helperfunctions etc.

<br>
I'm inspired by informations found on this sites:

Thanks a lot!
